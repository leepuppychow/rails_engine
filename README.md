# Rails Engine

Rails engine (Sales Engine via Rails) is a RESTful Business Intelligence API written in the Rails framework. It returns JSON data for Merchants, Customers, Invoices, Items, and Transactions.  In addition to RESTful show and index pages, there are several BI requests available. Please see below for specific URIs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ruby 2+  
Rails 4+  
See Gemfile for required gems and their versions  

### Installing

To run a Rails Engine from your machine, fork and clone. Navigate to the desired project folder on your machine and clone down your version

From your terminal

```
cd rails_engine
```
```
bundle
```
```
rails db:create db:migrate
```

For the CSV data, visit https://github.com/turingschool-examples/sales_engine/tree/master/data.
Download and save to Rails_engine/db/csv
Then from your terminal, run this command to seed your database (this can take several minutes)

```
rake import:all
```

Be sure to run
```
rails c
```
...and check that each of the tables have Active Record instances:
```
Merchant.first
Customer.first
Invoice.first
Item.first
Item_invoice.first
Transaction.first
```

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, simply run the rspec terminal command from the root of the project
```
rspec
```
The test suite verifies the functionality of API endpoints for JSON data.


## Deployment

To deploy your very own Rails engine, start a server from the project root directory
```
rails s
```
and navigate to localhost3000/api/v1/merchants to get started.

In addition to RESTful show and index pages, there are several BI requests available:  
Each table has:  
/api/v1/table/find?=      #search by attribute or column name  
/api/v1/table/find_all?=  #search by attribute or column name  
/api/v1/table/random      #returns a random resource  

In addition, API requests can be made using these endpoints:
